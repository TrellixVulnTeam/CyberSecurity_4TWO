## Laboratory 2
### How to run:
```
1. python Frontend.py
```
There is an interface done in python using tkinter library. Then we must choose the length of the key(of 128,192 or 256 bits), so it will be generated. Next you must introduce the text you want to encrypt with the AES algorithm. Then, when you press "Cypher" button there will appear the result of text encryption in the "Encrypted text" field. Then the encrypted text is decrypted and shown in the "Decrypted text" field.
